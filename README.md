=============

** Note: this is not completely finished and contains lots of minor bugs. **

The universe is not that peaceful. Different civilizations are always attacking each other,
for they never know whether each other is friendly.

And that's why the Cygnia civilization created a small universe and moved into it.

Soon the big universe shrinked and the big bang happened again, and there goes the new universe.

The Cygnians were eager to see the new universe, so they pushed out some simple machines
to the new universe and followed out.

Sadly, when they turned back, they didn't see the entrance of their small universe -
it's not visible under the slightly different physical laws.

So they could only stay, and the attacks among civilizations continue -
we call it the 'Dark Forest' state.

Controls
========

* Drag & drop the map to move around. Zoom in/out buttons are on the top-left corner.

* The time control button is in the bottom-left corner. Click to pause, double-click to fast-forward.

* The development control is on the bottom (those circles). Click to adjust Cygnia's development paces.

* As you develop basic science (fundamental science), you get spaceships and they gradually fly faster.

* As you develop energy, your energy consumption will decrease.

* As you develop fire, nothing happens right now. Maybe I'll make it after LD.

Gameplay
========

Your goal is to develop basic science to level 7 so that the Cygnians could create another
small universe to hide themselves in.

Everything orange is a solar system with livable planets. As light travels at
a limited speed, you can only see things in a limited range (the light cone).

If a vacant solar system is reached by your spacecrafts, it becomes yours. You
can launch other spacecrafts and Unconventional Weapons from there.

If a solar system with other civilizations on it is reached by your spacecrafts,
nothing happens now - perhaps I'll make it after LD. (again...)

Unconventional Weapons
======================

The Mass Point
--------------

This becomes available at the basic science level of 4.

It is a small object with a incredibly high speed and thus lots of energy.

When a solar system is reached by this, it is completely destroyed - along with
creatures on it.

The Dimension Decreaser
-----------------------

This becomes available at the basic science level of 5.

It is a kind of thing that can pull 3-D spaces to 2-D ones.

Everything it touches will be destroyed, so be careful when you use it.
